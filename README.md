## Description

This is an example of a minimalistic site with some small user-friendly animations, that ameliorate user experience and enhance the general look of the main page. The accent, in terms of design, is on the color palette, that is traced within each photo, and the way it matches with the colors of the interface. On part of front-end implementation, the pinpoint is the use of animation. Moreover, the code is fairly simple to maintain, since it is based on BEM methodology.
